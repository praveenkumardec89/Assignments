# ChessProblem

The problem is to find all unique configurations of a set of normal chess pieces on a chess board with dimensions M×N where none of the pieces is in a position to take any of the others. Assume the colour of the piece does not matter, and that there are no pawns among the pieces.

<b>Constraints</b>

<b>Input Pattern:</b>

•	The dimensions of the board: M, N
•	The number of pieces of each type (King, Queen, Bishop, Rook and Knight) to try and place on the board.

<b>Output Pattern</b>

Program should list all the unique configurations to the console for which all of the pieces can be placed on the board without threatening each other.

hashing and tracking back the previous positions is the main problem in this problem

Assuming that Ant 1.9.x & JRE 1.7 are installed on the system, 
type ant on the root directory of the project to run the program.
